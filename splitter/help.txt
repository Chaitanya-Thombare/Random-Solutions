What to put in the excel sheet?
    X - Expense Name(Dont bother)
    Cost - Self Explanatory
    Sponsor - The person who has paid that expense
    A,B,C,D - People who have consumed the product of that expense.

What is the 4th column exactly?
    The name of column should be comma seperated values of all the individuals involved.
    If 3 people are involved, you can put their names, like "Ajay, Bajaj, Chandu" in the column name.
    If an expense is consumed by 'n' people, the forth column value for that expense shall have 'n' comma seperated names.
    Make sure to refer those individuals exactly the same way as in the column name, and in sponsor column as well.
    I prefer initials instead of names because its easy. So should you.
