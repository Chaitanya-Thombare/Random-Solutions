What to put in the excel sheet?
    X - Expense Name(Don't bother)
    Cost - Self explanatory
    Sponsor - Again, self explanatory
    A,B,C,D - People who should contribute.

What exactly is the 4th column?
    The columnm name should be a comma seperated values. For 3 people are involved, column name could be, "Aaron, Blake, Denise".
    Say, an expense is consumed by 2 people, the fourth column would by like - Aaron, Denise
    Make sure the names are same throughout the column name and their values.
    I prefer initials over full names.
